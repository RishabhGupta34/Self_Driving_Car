# Self Driving Car
Machine learning model for building Self Driving Cars using Behavioral Cloning. For generating the dataset and testing the model I have used the udacity self driving car simulator.

# Testing the Model
python run.py --path="path-to-model-file"
For eg: python run.py --path=modelv6_0.1730.h5
